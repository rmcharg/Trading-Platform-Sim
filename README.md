# PyTrade
## Introduction
PyTrade is a trading simulator allowing users to interact with real time market data. This web application allows users to create accounts, buy/sell shares and track the behaviour of chosen stocks over custom periods of time. This project was built for the final project requirement of Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course.

## Description

- Portfolio Performance.
- Current total value of the shares of each stock the user holds.
- Current value of each stock in the users portfolio.
- Current value and trend of key stock market indexes.
- Graphs of any stocks performance over a chosen period of time.
