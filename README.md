# Python Portfolio Manager Sim
## Introduction
This portfolio manager simulation allows users to manage a portfolio of stocks and see how it will perform over time. Users can view their portfolio, it's composition and interact with market data in real time through the yahoo finance API.

This project was built for the final project requirement of Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course.

## Description
This project allows users to manage a portfolio of stocks over time interacting with real time market data. The application allows users to view:
- Portfolio Performance.
- Current total value of the shares of each stock the user holds.
- Current value of each stock in the users portfolio.
- Graphs of any stocks performance over a chosen period of time, and key market information about that stock such as volume, 52 week low/high, day low/high etc.

Each user starts with $10,000 cash to invest in the market. The user will be able to buy and sell stocks to grow the value of their portfolio.

## Future Changes
- Additional plotting choices e.g candlestick charts as well as plotting stock volume.
- Integration with more consistent API than yahoo finance API.

## Technologies Used
- Front End: Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jinja
- Back End: Flask, Python
- Database: SQLite
- API: yfinance
