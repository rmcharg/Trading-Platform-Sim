# Python Trading Simulator
## Introduction
Trading platform simulator allowing users to interact with real time market data and make investment decisions without risking real cash. This web application allows users to create accounts, buy/sell shares and track the behaviour of chosen stocks over custom periods of time. This project was built for the final project requirement of Harvards CS50 Introduction to Computer Science Course.

## Description
This project allows users to manage a portfolio of stocks over time interacting with real time market data. The application allows users to view:
- Portfolio Performance.
- Current total value of the shares of each stock the user holds.
- Current value of each stock in the users portfolio.
- Current value and trend of key stock market indexes.
- Graphs of any stocks performance over a chosen period of time.
Each user starts with $10,000 cash to invest in the market, as the user stock holdings change value, the total value of their portfolio will change as well. This simulated buying and selling of stocks allows for the user to practice 'investing' without risking any real cash.

## Future Changes
- Real time graphing of stock performance in an individual day.
- Additional information to be added to stock tracker page (open, high, low, mktcap, 52wk high etc.).
- Additional plotting choices e.g candlestick charts as well as plotting stock volume.

## Technologies Used
- Front End: Bootstrap, JavaScript, Jinja
- Back End: Flask, Python
- Database: SQLite
- API: yfinance
